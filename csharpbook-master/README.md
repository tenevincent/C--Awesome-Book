All code from the book is organized in ready-to-run projects and grouped by chapters. Whenever possible, these are cross-platform .NET Core projects which run on every supported platform from a code editor like Visual Studio 2017 or Visual Studio Code, and even from command line. For exceptions, requirements are explained in the `README.md` file of each chapter folder.

You are encouraged to run the code, modify it and further experiment with it.

## Software requirements

Most code will work with .NET Core 2.2 on any supported platform. You can find installation instructions on [the download page](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). Exact prerequisites for each platform are listed in the documentation ([Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/windows-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x), [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/linux-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x) or [macOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/macos-prerequisites?tabs=netcore2x)). The only exceptions are:

* Windows-specific features (Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and ASP.NET) require the latest version of .NET framework running on Windows.

* C# 8 topics require .NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 or later and Visual Studio 2019 Preview 1 or later.
